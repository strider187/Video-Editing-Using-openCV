# Video-Editing-Using-openCV
In this repository, we work with openCV in Python to detect the shape and color of various images present inside the video, like triangle, pentagon, circle, etc. and will overlay an flower's image based on the color of the shape.
We are only using 3 colors right now to study the overlay, for more color we need to edit the code according to color hash table.
